# Machine Learning (ML) validation sweeps for finding optimal hyper-parameter settings.

Simple, automatic code both MLP and MoE algorithms to 'sweep' over hyper-parameters in order to find optimal values.

### MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) 
Uses MATLAB source code only, but **Neural Network Toolbox** required.

### Mixture of Experts (MoE) 
Uses (slight alteration of) [Gokar Erdogan's](https://goker.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/mixture-of-experts/) code, not included here.
