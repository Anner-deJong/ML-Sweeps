# Machine Learning (ML) validation sweeps for finding optimal hyper-parameter settings.

Simple, automatic code for both MLP and MoE algorithms to 'sweep' over hyper-parameters in order to find optimal values. Output consists of **_Correct Classification Rates_** (CCRs), written to an Excel file. Prior to running, load your Training - and Validation data into '*X_Train*', '*Y_Train*', '*X_Valid*' & '*Y_Valid*'.


### MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) 
Uses MATLAB source code only, but **Neural Network Toolbox** required.

### Mixture of Experts (MoE) 
Uses (slight alteration of) [Gokar Erdogan's](https://goker.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/mixture-of-experts/) code, not included in this repository.
